            <header class="intro__text">
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, <span class="highlight">object-oriented</span> scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p> JavaScript contains a standard library of <span class="highlight">objects</span>, such as <span
                        class="highlight">Arrays</span> , <span class="highlight">Date</span> , and <span class="highlight">Math</span> , and a core set of
                    language elements such as <span class="highlight"> operators</span> , <span class="highlight">control structures</span> , and
                    <span class="highlight">statements</span>. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
            </header>
            <ul class="intro__container details">
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    <span class="highlight">Document Object Model (DOM).</span>
                </li>
                <li>For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an <span class="highlight">HTML form </span>and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Server-side JavaScript</span> extends the core language by supplying objects
                    relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server.</li>
                <li>
                    For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.

            <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
            <header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                    follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
                    the
                    reason why it was renamed from <span class="highlight">LiveScript</span> to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime
                    system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                    JavaScript has a <span class="highlight">prototype-based object model</span> instead of the more
                    common class-based object model.
                    The
                    prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                    individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
                    can
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. <span class="highlight">Variables</span>,
                    <span class="highlight">parameters</span>, and <span class="highlight">function</span> return
                    types
                    are not explicitly typed.

        <section class="main-section content-box" id="hello_world">
            <h2>Hello world</h2>
            <header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript
                    code: <code class="highlight">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World");</code> </p>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit <span class="highlight">Ctrl+R</span> to watch it unfold in your
                    browser! </p>
            </header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section content-box" id="variables">
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a <span class="highlight">letter</span>, <span
                        class="highlight">underscore (_)</span>, or <span class="highlight">dollar sign ($)</span>;
                    subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use <span class="highlight">ISO 8859-1</span> or <span class="highlight">Unicode</span>
                    letters such as <span class="highlight">å</span> and <span class="highlight">ü</span> in
                    identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode
                    escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99,
                    and
                    _name</p>
